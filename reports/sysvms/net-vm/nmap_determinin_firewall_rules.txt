Step 1: Basic SYN scan to check open/filtered ports on 192.168.1.10
Not shown: 65531 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
22/tcp   open   ssh
53/tcp   closed domain
9000/tcp closed cslistener
9010/tcp closed sdr

[*] Interpretation of results:
Port 22/tcp is open: The target is accepting TCP connections on this port.
Port 53/tcp is closed: The port is reachable but no service is listening.
Port 9000/tcp is closed: The port is reachable but no service is listening.
Port 9010/tcp is closed: The port is reachable but no service is listening.

Step 2: ACK scan to detect firewall statefulness on 192.168.1.10
Not shown: 65531 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
22/tcp   unfiltered ssh
53/tcp   unfiltered domain
9000/tcp unfiltered cslistener
9010/tcp unfiltered sdr

[*] Interpretation of ACK scan:
22/tcp likely reachable (RST received) — might be stateless firewall or none
53/tcp likely reachable (RST received) — might be stateless firewall or none
9000/tcp likely reachable (RST received) — might be stateless firewall or none
9010/tcp likely reachable (RST received) — might be stateless firewall or none

Step 3: Spoofed source IPs test using spoof_ips.txt

[>] Testing with spoofed IP: 192.168.0.1
[*] Replies received — target may accept spoofed traffic!

[>] Testing with spoofed IP: 10.0.0.5
[*] Replies received — target may accept spoofed traffic!

[>] Testing with spoofed IP: 127.0.0.1
[*] Replies received — target may accept spoofed traffic!

Step 4: UDP scan with version detection on all UDP ports for 192.168.1.10
22/udp   open|filtered ssh
53/udp   closed        domain
9000/udp open|filtered cslistener
9010/udp open|filtered unknown

[*] Interpretation of UDP scan results:
Port 22/udp (ssh) state is open|filtered: Unusual or unknown state.
Port 53/udp (domain) is closed: The port is reachable but no service is listening.
Port 9000/udp (cslistener) state is open|filtered: Unusual or unknown state.
Port 9010/udp (unknown) state is open|filtered: Unusual or unknown state.
